description: During this workshop you will learn how to use fully-managed Confluent Cloud on AWS to source historical data into Kafka, accept streaming credit applications in real time and use ksqlDB to process data together and generate request outcome. Once applications outcome is decided, it will sink the approved and not approved application events into Amazon Redshift and finally we will visualize this data using Amazon QuickSight.
