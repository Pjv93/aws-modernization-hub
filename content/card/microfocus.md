description: In this workshop, you’ll discover why AI-based functional testing is an essential DevOps practice that builds quality into your application delivery pipeline, helping you to reduce test creation time, boost test coverage, increase resilience of testing assets, and cut down on test maintenance efforts. We’ll guide you through the process of designing an AI-based GUI test in UFT One by recording a flow through a web-based application under test, running the test in a browser, and inspecting the results of the test run and the details of each step in the test.
